# Mist
Mist is a 2D game engine inspired by Unreal.

It is written primarily in Lua, with some functionality, like OS interaction and the basics of graphics subsystem, is implemented in C++11.

The facilities of the engine may also be used for other purposes. For example, 'img' library uses them for high-precision image processing.

The engine is still very early in development. The codebase is rather unstable, so there's also a large amount of code in the project that is either obsolete, or not adapted to the changed interfaces.
